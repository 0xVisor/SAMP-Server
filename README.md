### How To Use
First of all, you may need to put all your database, such as player data and etc in database folders.
So, how does it works?
The HTTP server will host a server in port 80, then when you are connecting in with a SAMP client, it'll then send request to database path.

To use it you may need to change value in **index.js**
and then run it with your terminal
```python
$ node index.js
```
